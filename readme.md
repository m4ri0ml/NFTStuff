# 0xM4R10 NFTStuff

This repo contains a small part of some of the (unoptimized, unaudited and probably bad) solidity code that I wrote to familiarize myself with the ERC721 standard, its iterations and NFT's in general.

If someday I decide to revive and work on some of the proyects here I will probably move them to their own repo once they are not spaguetti code.
